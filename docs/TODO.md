- [X] Check what's wrong with the pre-commit hooks.
- [ ] Index: fix alignment of grid title and "new" button;
- [ ] Admin pages:
    - [ ] add counters to the right of the top bar;
    - [ ] fix vertical gap of back link and "new" button.
- [ ] Database migration: add subcategory as optional division for category.
    - [ ] When a category has subcategories, enforce its selection on the listing form.
- [ ] Listing form:

        - [ ] allow adding to and removing from the selected images list.
- [ ] Base: add search field to top bar.
      What are the requirements for the user interface for searching and filtering classified ads?
- [ ] Figure out an "ID" for the interface of the application:
    - [ ] fonts;
    - [ ] color palette.
- [ ] Unify management of "types" and "categories" on a single screen.
      Problem: a unified screen for this purpose would only work well in a single page application, with dynamic fields, REST API, etc. Leave it as is and come back to it later.
