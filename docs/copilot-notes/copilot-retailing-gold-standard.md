# Original dialog with Mr. Copilot

Q.: Considering everything you know about software oriented to retailing, sales, classifieds, etc.: is there much more to do, other that manage listings, organizing these listings in a hierarchical structure, and manage users?

A.: Great question! While managing listings, organizing them hierarchically, and managing users are the core foundational features for software focused on retail, sales, or classifieds, most real-world applications in this area end up with a broader set of features to provide value, safety, and usability for all participants.

    Geocoding addresses

8. Notifications

    Email, SMS, or push notifications for messages, offers, etc.
    Alerts for saved searches or price drops

9. Analytics and Insights

    Dashboard for sellers (views, inquiries, sales)
    Platform-wide analytics for admins

10. Content Management

    Blog/news section, help articles, FAQs
