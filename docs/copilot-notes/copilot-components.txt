# Upgrade pip and install from requirements
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Upgrade all packages listed to their newest releases
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Upgrade a single package
pip install --upgrade requests

Short answer: treat these tools as “dev dependencies” and manage them separately from runtime requirements. Two common, safe approaches:

Use pre-commit to pin/run formatters/linters on commit (recommended).
Or keep a requirements-dev.txt (or use pipx) and install/update tools in your dev environment/CI.
Setup examples and commands

Create a small requirements-dev.txt (store pinned versions)
Install in a venv and keep updated
Use pre-commit to run and pin hooks (preferred)
Add a .pre-commit-config.yaml to pin exact hook revisions and enable running on commits / CI.
Install and use pre-commit:

Alternatives

pipx: install tools globally per-tool (pipx install ruff black) so you don't pollute project venv.
pip-tools: manage pins via requirements.in -> pip-compile -> requirements.txt for repeatable installs.
CI

In CI, either install requirements-dev.txt or install pre-commit and run pre-commit run --all-files (or run tools directly) so checks match local dev.
Recommendation

Keep pyproject.toml for tool configuration (black/isort/ruff settings) and use pre-commit + requirements-dev.txt to pin and update tool versions reproducibly. Use pre-commit autoupdate or update requirements-dev.txt and re-install to manage upgrades.
