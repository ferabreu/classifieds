Thsi sprint was meant to correct the code styling to CS50x's standards, and writing of CS50x's final report. But it ended up getting a refactor in listings.py (decoupled file deletion logic with helper functions), a fix for the "forgot password" functionality, and maybe some other stuff I forgot about...

So, no formal planning. But development went very well. And CS50x's final project was a success. :-)
